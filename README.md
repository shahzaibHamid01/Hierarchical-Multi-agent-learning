# Reinforecement-Learning
This code is regarding reinforcement learning through MATLAB.
The code focuses on hierarchical multi-agent robotic search team for unknown environment.
For more help the research paper is given as https://doi.org/10.22581/muet1982.2103.17 
To run this code you must have an updated version of MATLAB and a command on basic level language like C/C++.
Codes regarding Global agent must be run before and local agent must be run later.
Reward, Transisition Probability, Policy evaluation and calculation are main parts of both codes.
Other code parts are as supporting code for these functions.
